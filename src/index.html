<h1>Aync JavaScript with RxJS</h1>
<p>A stream is a sequence of events over time</p>
<pre>A stream can emit three kinds of events:
    values
    an × error: e
    a ◉ complete notification</pre>
<p>After an × error: e or a ◉ complete notification, nothing else is emitted by the stream.</p>
<p>A listener can receive those three kinds of events. So, it can consume the values, handle an error and act upon completion of the subscribed stream.</p>
